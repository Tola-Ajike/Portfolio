Project Clustering

This project uses different clustering methods including K-means & hierarchical to analyse a 
census dataset, focusing on demographic information. Each clustering method was applied, and the resulting clusters were 
evaluated using metrics such as sum_of_square and silhouette scores to assess their quality.
