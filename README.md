Hello there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Tola Ajike and I am a Computer Science graduate. I have a curious mind and like to work on projects that tell stories and share insights whether that is by creating data visualizations, insightful PowerPoint presentations and designs or writing code that solves a problem.

My professional experience involved working in cybersecurity at Help AG, process improvement at Fragomen and currently my graduation project where I lead my team in developing a computer vision application for Dunkin' Donuts UAE!

That's a bit about me, now here is my portfolio!
