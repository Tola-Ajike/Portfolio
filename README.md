Hello there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Tola Ajike, and I am a Computer Science graduate. I am curious and like to work on projects that tell stories and share insights, whether by creating data visualizations, insightful PowerPoint presentations and designs, or code that solves a problem.

I led a successful senior project developing an AI web application for a multinational company, winning first place at the project demonstration. I am seeking an entry-level position that will allow me to utilize my technical skills and contribute to creating cutting-edge, innovative solutions.

Technical Skills: SQL, Python, Java, MS Office, Power BI, Figma, Data Visualization, R, Project Management, SPSS, AI.
